**Note:**   
**Initialization** is not equal to **Assignment**.  
The meaning of **initialization** is to give variable a intial value when creating it, and the meaning of **assignment** is to erase the current value of object, then replace it with a new value.

List initialization (using curly braces) is better than the alternatives.

```C++
MyClass a1 {a};     // clearer and less error-prone than the other three
MyClass a2 = {a};
MyClass a3 = a;
MyClass a4(a);
```

Basically copying and pasting from Bjarne Stroustrup's "The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition":

List initialization does not allow narrowing (Â§iso.8.5.4). That is:

- An integer cannot be converted to another integer that cannot hold its value. For example, char to int is allowed, but not int to char.
- A floating-point value cannot be converted to another floating-point type that cannot hold its value. For example, float to double is allowed, but not double to float.
- A floating-point value cannot be converted to an integer type.
- An integer value cannot be converted to a floating-point type.

*Example:*
```C++
void fun(double val, int val2) {

    int x2 = val; // if val==7.9, x2 becomes 7 (bad)

    char c2 = val2; // if val2==1025, c2 becomes 1 (bad)

    int x3 {val}; // error: possible truncation (good)

    char c3 {val2}; // error: possible narrowing (good)

    char c4 {24}; // OK: 24 can be represented exactly as a char (good)

    char c5 {264}; // error (assuming 8-bit chars): 264 cannot be 
                   // represented as a char (good)

    int x4 {2.0}; // error: no double to int value conversion (good)

}
```
The only situation where = is preferred over {} is when using auto keyword to get the type determined by the initializer.

*Example*
```C++
auto z1 {99};   // z1 is an int
auto z2 = {99}; // z2 is std::initializer_list<int>
auto z3 = 99;   // z3 is an int
```
## Conclusion
Prefer {} initialization over alternatives unless you have a strong reason not to.
